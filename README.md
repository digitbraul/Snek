# Snek
Classic Snake game in Lua/LÖVE

---

This is a simple game, it's probably been done before but I wanted to make one myself in the shortest time possible to keep myself distracted.
I'll probably port this to the 3DS using LövePotion.
I don't know if I'm going to draw the snake for now, maybe a rectangle will do?

At least the menu is complete. As for the options though, I don't know, maybe setting the screen resolution and brightness?
